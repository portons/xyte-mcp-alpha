Okay, I've analyzed your `repomix-output.txt` which provides a good overview of your Xyte MCP Alpha server's structure. It appears to be a Python-based MCP server, likely leveraging a framework such as FastMCP or the official Python SDK for MCP, given the use of `mcp dev` and `stdio_server`. The project interacts with a Xyte API, handles configuration via environment variables, and has some error handling and testing (`pytest`) in place.

Based on this understanding and the extensive research on latest MCP developments, best practices, and libraries, here's a detailed plan with tasks for your AI agent (or development team) to implement fixes, adjustments, and additional functionalities for your XYTE MCP server.

## Detailed Implementation Plan for XYTE MCP Server

**Overall Goals:**
* Enhance robustness, security, and maintainability of the existing MCP server.
* Improve the developer experience and operational efficiency.
* Expand capabilities to provide more powerful and flexible AV automation through AI agents.
* Align with industry best practices for MCP server development.

---

**A. Codebase Analysis, Refinement, and Best Practice Alignment**

This section focuses on improving the existing foundation of your `xyte-mcp-alpha` server.

* [ ] **Task A1: Deep Code Review and SDK Alignment**
   * **Description:** Conduct a thorough review of `src/xyte_mcp_alpha/server.py`, `handlers.py`, `clients/xyte.py`, and `schemas.py`. Ensure consistent and optimal use of the chosen MCP SDK (e.g., FastMCP or official Python SDK).
   * **Rationale:** Identify any manual MCP protocol handling that could be simplified by SDK features, ensure type hinting is consistently used (as suggested by FastMCP for better validation and editor support), and optimize the interaction flow between MCP requests, Xyte API client, and response handling.
   * **Action Items:**
      * Verify that tool, resource, and prompt definitions leverage SDK decorators and features correctly.
      * Refactor any overly complex logic in request handling.
      * Ensure the Xyte API client (`clients/xyte.py`) efficiently manages connections and gracefully handles API-specific errors before they are translated to `MCPError`.

* [v] **Task A2: Enhance Input Validation and Sanitization**
   * **Description:** Review and bolster input validation for all MCP tools and resources, likely within `schemas.py` (if using Pydantic or similar) and at the entry points of your handlers in `server.py`.
   * **Rationale:** Critical for security and stability, preventing injection attacks, unexpected behavior, or crashes when AI agents provide malformed or malicious inputs. MCP best practices emphasize rigorous input validation.
   * **Action Items:**
      * For each tool/resource, define strict schemas for expected inputs (e.g., using Pydantic).
      * Implement validation against these schemas at the earliest point of request processing.
      * Sanitize any free-text inputs that might be used in constructing API calls or system commands (though direct system command execution should be avoided).
      * Return clear `MCPError` (e.g., `InvalidParams`) for validation failures.

* [ ] **Task A3: Strengthen Error Handling and Reporting**
   * **Description:** Expand on the existing error handling (`MCPError` exceptions, Xyte API status code translation). Implement more granular error reporting and ensure all error paths are covered.
   * **Rationale:** Provides clearer feedback to AI agents and aids debugging. The current translation of Xyte API errors is good; this task aims to make it comprehensive.
   * **Action Items:**
      * Map a wider range of Xyte API errors to specific MCP error codes (e.g., `InternalError`, `MethodNotFound`, custom errors if appropriate).
      * Ensure consistent error structure in responses.
      * For critical errors, provide enough context in server logs (without exposing sensitive data) for easier diagnosis.
      * Consider using the `Context` object (if using FastMCP) for standardized error logging within tools/resources.

* [x] **Task A4: Refine Configuration Management**
   * **Description:** Review `config.py` and environment variable usage. Ensure configurations are loaded securely and efficiently, and consider support for different environments (dev, staging, prod).
   * **Rationale:** Robust configuration is key for operational stability and security.
   * **Action Items:**
      * Use a library like Pydantic for settings management to get type validation and clear defaults.
      * Ensure sensitive information like `XYTE_API_KEY` is not logged or accidentally exposed.
      * Document all environment variables clearly.
      * Consider structured configuration for different deployment environments if not already in place.

* [x] **Task A5: Security Hardening**
   * **Description:** Implement comprehensive security best practices beyond basic input validation and secret management.
   * **Rationale:** MCP servers can become powerful interfaces to backend systems (like Xyte for AV control), making security paramount. This aligns with research on MCP vulnerabilities (unauthenticated access, over-permissioned tokens, etc.).
   * **Action Items:**
      * **Least Privilege for Xyte API Key:** Ensure the `XYTE_API_KEY` used by the server has the minimum necessary permissions on the Xyte platform for the tasks the MCP server needs to perform.
      * **Per-User Authorization (if `XYTE_USER_TOKEN` is used):** If supporting per-user tokens, implement robust authentication and authorization for the MCP server itself to determine if a connected AI agent (or its end-user) is allowed to use that token and perform specific actions. This might involve OAuth 2.0 or a similar mechanism if the MCP server is accessed remotely, though `stdio_server` implies local usage for now.
      * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on tool/resource access to prevent abuse or accidental overload of the Xyte API.
      * **Audit Logging for Security Events:** Log all significant security-related events (e.g., authentication attempts, authorization failures, critical tool invocations).
      * **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

* [ ] **Task A6: Improve Logging and Monitoring Capabilities**
   * **Description:** Enhance the existing error logging to be more comprehensive and structured. Implement performance and usage monitoring.
   * **Rationale:** Essential for debugging, understanding server usage, identifying performance bottlenecks, and detecting anomalies. Official MCP documentation and AWS best practices emphasize this.
   * **Action Items:**
      * Implement structured logging (e.g., JSON format) for all MCP requests, responses (summary), errors, and significant events. Include correlation IDs for tracing requests.
      * Log Xyte API call latencies and success/failure rates.
      * Capture performance metrics for each MCP tool/resource (e.g., execution time).
      * Integrate with a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana if deployed in a container, or cloud-specific solutions like AWS CloudWatch if applicable in the future).
      * Use the `Context` object for logging within tools/resources if using a framework like FastMCP.

**B. Enhancing MCP Core Functionality (Tools, Resources, Prompts)**

This section focuses on leveraging the full potential of the Model Context Protocol.

* [v] **Task B1: Optimize Tool Definitions and Implementations**
   * **Description:** Review and refine the existing tools exposed by the MCP server. Ensure they are well-defined, atomic, and provide clear descriptions for AI agent consumption.
   * **Rationale:** Clear and well-scoped tools are easier for AI agents to understand and use correctly. The official MCP documentation and SDKs (like FastMCP) provide guidance on tool annotations and schemas.
   * **Action Items:**
      * Ensure tool names and descriptions are unambiguous and accurately reflect their functionality for the AI.
      * Use detailed JSON Schema definitions for parameters (likely via Pydantic in `schemas.py`).
      * Include examples in tool descriptions where helpful.
      * Break down complex operations into smaller, more atomic tools if applicable.
      * Leverage tool annotations (e.g., `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint` from MCP specification) if supported by your SDK and relevant to AV control.

* [v] **Task B2: Structure and Expose Resources Effectively**
   * **Description:** Identify and expose relevant data from the Xyte platform as MCP resources. This could include device lists, device statuses, room configurations, etc.
   * **Rationale:** Resources provide contextual information to AI agents, enhancing their ability to make informed decisions before invoking tools.
   * **Action Items:**
      * Define clear URIs for resources (e.g., `xyte://devices/{deviceId}/status`).
      * Implement functions to fetch and format this data, returning it as structured content.
      * Consider caching for frequently accessed, slowly changing resources to improve performance.
      * Ensure resources are read-only or have minimal side effects.

* [v] **Task B3: Develop and Utilize Prompts for Common Workflows**
   * **Description:** Define MCP prompts for common AV automation workflows that AI agents can use.
   * **Rationale:** Prompts are reusable instruction templates, guiding AI agents on how to interact with your server for specific tasks, simplifying complex operations.
   * **Action Items:**
      * Identify recurring AV automation tasks (e.g., "reboot unresponsive device in meeting room X," "check health of all projectors").
      * Create MCP prompt templates that structure the necessary information and tool calls for these tasks.
      * Expose these prompts through the MCP server.

* [v] **Task B4: Implement Advanced Context Management**
   * **Description:** If complex, multi-turn interactions are expected, explore more sophisticated context management techniques.
   * **Rationale:** For AI agents performing complex AV diagnostic or control sequences, maintaining context across multiple requests is crucial.
   * **Action Items:**
      * Review how session context is handled (MCP is inherently stateful per session).
      * If using FastMCP, leverage its `Context` object for session-specific information and capabilities.
      * For long-running tasks initiated by a tool, consider patterns for reporting progress or intermediate results if the MCP client supports it (e.g., via notifications or follow-up resource checks).

**C. Implementing Additional Functionalities**

This section outlines new features to expand the server's capabilities.

* [ ] **Task C1: Support for Dynamic Tool/Resource Discovery (If applicable)**
   * **Description:** If the range of Xyte devices or available actions changes frequently, consider mechanisms for AI agents to dynamically discover available tools and resources.
   * **Rationale:** Makes the MCP server more adaptive to changes in the underlying Xyte platform or device capabilities. MCP specification includes `tools/list` and `resources/list` methods.
   * **Action Items:**
      * Ensure your server correctly implements the standard MCP methods for listing available tools and resources with up-to-date information.
      * If capabilities can change during a session, implement `notifications/tools/list_changed` and `notifications/resources/list_changed`.

* [ ] **Task C2: Event-Driven Interactions for AV Automation**
   * **Description:** Explore integration with event streams from the Xyte platform or AV devices to enable proactive AI agent responses.
   * **Rationale:** AV systems often generate events (e.g., device offline, error detected). MCP could enable AI agents to subscribe to or be notified of these events and take autonomous action.
   * **Action Items:**
      * Investigate if Xyte platform offers webhooks or other event notification mechanisms.
      * Design MCP tools or resources that allow AI agents to manage subscriptions to relevant AV events.
      * Implement server-side logic to receive these events and potentially trigger AI agent interactions or specific MCP tool calls based on predefined rules or AI decisions. This might involve the MCP server acting as a client to another service or exposing a notification mechanism.

* [ ] **Task C3: User-Specific Context and Personalization (Advanced)**
   * **Description:** If different users or AI agents have different permissions or preferred devices/rooms, implement mechanisms to tailor the MCP server's behavior accordingly.
   * **Rationale:** Provides a more personalized and secure experience, especially if the `XYTE_USER_TOKEN` is used to represent different end-users.
   * **Action Items:**
      * Based on the authenticated user/agent, filter the list of available tools, resources, or their operational scope.
      * Store user preferences (e.g., default rooms, preferred devices) and make them available as resources or use them to tailor prompt responses.

* [ ] **Task C4: Asynchronous Operations and Progress Reporting**
   * **Description:** For Xyte API calls or AV automation tasks that may take a long time, implement asynchronous tool execution with progress reporting.
   * **Rationale:** Prevents MCP client timeouts and provides a better user experience for AI agents.
   * **Action Items:**
      * Design tools that can initiate long-running operations and return an immediate acknowledgment (e.g., a task ID).
      * Provide separate tools or resources for AI agents to query the status of these operations using the task ID.
      * Utilize `ctx.report_progress(completed, total)` if using FastMCP for operations within a single tool call.

* [ ] **Task C5: Deep Integration with Xyte Universal Device APIs**
   * **Description:** Ensure the MCP server tools and resources fully leverage the capabilities advertised by Xyte for their Universal Device APIs in conjunction with MCP.
   * **Rationale:** Xyte's own announcements emphasize this synergy for AI-driven automation (automated room recovery, dynamic reassignment, proactive maintenance).
   * **Action Items:**
      * Review Xyte's documentation on their Universal Device APIs and how they envision them being used with MCP.
      * Develop specific MCP tools that map directly to these advanced AV management tasks (e.g., `rebootDevice`, `getDeviceHealth`, `reassignMeeting`).
