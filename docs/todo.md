# 🛠️ Codebase Improvement Tasks

## 🚩 **Documentation**

* [x] Expand `README.md` with:

    * [x] Setup steps (dev/prod)
    * [x] Configuration guide (env vars, options)
    * [x] API usage examples (code/curl)
    * [x] Explanation of core components and architecture
* [x] Create `docs/PLUGINS.md` with:

    * [x] Plugin architecture overview
    * [x] Step-by-step plugin development/registration guide
    * [x] Realistic code examples
* [x] Add `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`:

    * [x] Kubernetes/Helm install instructions
    * [x] Explanation of key Helm values and manifests
    * [x] Upgrade and rollback notes

## ✅ **Testing**

* [x] Audit and expand unit tests for all modules
* [x] Add integration tests (especially for plugin system & API)
* [x] Add negative/error scenario tests
* [x] Use `pytest-cov` to generate code coverage report
* [x] Add coverage badge to `README.md`
* [x] Create `tests/README.md` with structure & running instructions

## 💎 **Code Quality & Style**

* [x] Run and fix all linter issues (`ruff`, `black`, or similar)
* [x] Add pre-commit hooks for linting and typing (`pre-commit`)
* [x] Add type hints to all functions/modules
* [x] Refactor monolithic files (e.g., `server.py`, `tools.py`) into smaller, focused modules
* [x] Standardize error handling (use custom exceptions where appropriate)

## 📜 **Logging & Observability**

* [x] Unify logging (one utility, consistent usage)
* [x] Document logging configuration and log levels
* [x] Ensure all core actions/events are logged
* [x] Provide example Grafana dashboard for Prometheus metrics

## 🔒 **Security**

* [x] Add a `SECURITY.md` with:

    * [x] Security best practices
    * [x] How to report vulnerabilities
    * [x] Token/secret management
* [x] Review Dockerfile for security (run as non-root user, minimize layers)
* [x] Document recommended .env practices and secrets rotation

## 🚀 **CI/CD & Automation**

* [x] Expand `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to:

    * [x] Run lint, type checks, and all tests
    * [x] Build Docker image
    * [x] Upload coverage to Codecov/coveralls
    * [x] (Optionally) push image to registry on release
* [x] Add status and coverage badges to `README.md`
* [x] (Optional) Add dependency updates (renovatebot/dependabot)

## 🔌 **Plugin System**

* [x] Document plugin lifecycle (install, register, reload, validate)
* [x] Add realistic plugin integration test(s)
* [x] (Optional) Implement entry-point-based plugin discovery
* [x] Validate plugins on load (schema, compatibility)

## 🗂️ **API & Config**

* [x] Auto-generate and publish OpenAPI/Swagger docs
* [x] Provide Postman/curl examples for main endpoints
* [x] Validate config on startup; fail fast with errors
* [x] Document `values.yaml` schema for Helm users

## ⚡ **Advanced / Optional**

* [ ] Add SAST/DAST tools (e.g., Bandit, Trivy) to CI
* [ ] Provide an interactive API playground (in `examples/` or docs)
* [ ] Version the plugin API and document stability/support guarantees
* [ ] Add a support policy and responsible disclosure statement
