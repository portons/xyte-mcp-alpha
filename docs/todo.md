# 🛠️ Codebase Improvement Tasks

## 🚩 **Documentation**

* [ ] Expand `README.md` with:

    * [ ] Setup steps (dev/prod)
    * [ ] Configuration guide (env vars, options)
    * [ ] API usage examples (code/curl)
    * [ ] Explanation of core components and architecture
* [ ] Create `docs/PLUGINS.md` with:

    * [ ] Plugin architecture overview
    * [ ] Step-by-step plugin development/registration guide
    * [ ] Realistic code examples
* [ ] Add `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`:

    * [ ] Kubernetes/Helm install instructions
    * [ ] Explanation of key Helm values and manifests
    * [ ] Upgrade and rollback notes

## ✅ **Testing**

* [x] Audit and expand unit tests for all modules
* [x] Add integration tests (especially for plugin system & API)
* [x] Add negative/error scenario tests
* [x] Use `pytest-cov` to generate code coverage report
* [x] Add coverage badge to `README.md`
* [x] Create `tests/README.md` with structure & running instructions

## 💎 **Code Quality & Style**

* [ ] Run and fix all linter issues (`ruff`, `black`, or similar)
* [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for linting and typing (`pre-commit`)
* [ ] Add type hints to all functions/modules
* [ ] Refactor monolithic files (e.g., `server.py`, `tools.py`) into smaller, focused modules
* [ ] Standardize error handling (use custom exceptions where appropriate)

## 📜 **Logging & Observability**

* [ ] Unify logging (one utility, consistent usage)
* [ ] Document logging configuration and log levels
* [ ] Ensure all core actions/events are logged
* [ ] Provide example Grafana dashboard for Prometheus metrics

## 🔒 **Security**

* [ ] Add a `SECURITY.md` with:

    * [ ] Security best practices
    * [ ] How to report vulnerabilities
    * [ ] Token/secret management
* [ ] Review Dockerfile for security (run as non-root user, minimize layers)
* [ ] Document recommended .env practices and secrets rotation

## 🚀 **CI/CD & Automation**

* [ ] Expand `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to:

    * [ ] Run lint, type checks, and all tests
    * [ ] Build Docker image
    * [ ] Upload coverage to Codecov/coveralls
    * [ ] (Optionally) push image to registry on release
* [ ] Add status and coverage badges to `README.md`
* [ ] (Optional) Add dependency updates (renovatebot/dependabot)

## 🔌 **Plugin System**

* [ ] Document plugin lifecycle (install, register, reload, validate)
* [ ] Add realistic plugin integration test(s)
* [ ] (Optional) Implement entry-point-based plugin discovery
* [ ] Validate plugins on load (schema, compatibility)

## 🗂️ **API & Config**

* [ ] Auto-generate and publish OpenAPI/Swagger docs
* [ ] Provide Postman/curl examples for main endpoints
* [ ] Validate config on startup; fail fast with errors
* [ ] Document `values.yaml` schema for Helm users

## ⚡ **Advanced / Optional**

* [ ] Add SAST/DAST tools (e.g., Bandit, Trivy) to CI
* [ ] Provide an interactive API playground (in `examples/` or docs)
* [ ] Version the plugin API and document stability/support guarantees
* [ ] Add a support policy and responsible disclosure statement
